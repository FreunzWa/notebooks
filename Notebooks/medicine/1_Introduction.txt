====== 1 Introduction ======

This notebook contains a system-based approach to studying medicine. 
Each system area explores constituent pathologies, with a clinical approach to each condition (diagnosis and treatment).

The diagnostic components focus on tests (including blood tests, pathology, radiology and so forth) undertaken to confirm or exclude
diagnoses.
