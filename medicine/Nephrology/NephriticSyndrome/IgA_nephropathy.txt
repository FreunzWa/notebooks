====== IgA nephropathy ======

==== aka. Berger's disease/ synpharyngitic GN ====
{{./pasted_image002.png}}
Def: 
* ++common GN esp @developed countries, esp in 20-30s, inflamm response @failure to excrete IgA == ++collection @kidey == nephritis
* @++IgA production esp in response @URTI/ tonsillitis, possibly @inherent abnormality in IgA structure. 
* Systemic form is [[Rheumatology:Vasculitides:Henoch-SchonleinGN]] 
* Has severe/ mild forms with variable prognosis, and can progress to CKD decades after insult/ %%rapid progression (as a form of rapidly progressive crescenteric GN). 5-10% chance of complete remission @severe Berger's.
* 2x more @male, rare @blacks, ++common caucasian/ east asian
* GPA

Sx:
* %asymptomatic "latent" (but +ve on biopsy)
* usu <5 days after an esp URTI
* episodic gross haematuria (followed by microhaematuria) {looks like brown urine} 40-50%, usu provoked @viral URTI
* %loin pain
* %HTN
* peripheral edema

Ix:
* Urinalysis == microhaematuria/ %albumuria (<2g /day)/ glomerular RBCs + red cell cast formation. 
* USS of kidney + cystoscopy to confrm source == rule out renal calc/ TCC
* Renal biopsy confirms diagnosis 
	* Immunofluoresnce + EM to show mesangial IgA dominant deposits. IgG codeposition == bad outcomes. 
	* Glomerular deposition of C3 >90%. C1q absent. (suggestive of alternative pathway)
	* %glomeular fibrin deposition (more common @HSP)
* ANCA (GPA/ MPA association rule out)
* ANA/ AMA/ anti-GBM antibodies

Rx:


Cx:
* Recurs in transplant patients despite immunosuppression
* CKD progression in most, often decades after insult
* Worse outcomes in proteinuria >2g/day, HTN, male, hyperlipidaemia, age, familial disease, ++creatinine
