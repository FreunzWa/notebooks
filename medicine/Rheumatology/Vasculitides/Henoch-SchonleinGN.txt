====== Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) ======

==== aka. IgA mediated vasculitis ====
{{./pasted_image.png}}
__Def__:
* IgA mediated Vasculitis affecting skin, mucous membranes, kidneys 90% in children. (most common vasculitis in children 3-15 yrs)
* Presents w/ palpable purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain, %haematuria
* usu self resolving within weeks without treatment. 1/3 of cases relapses == CKD in adults. 
* 1.5x @male, HLA assocaitons. 
* more common onset @winter, rare in summer thought to be @less infections in summer == no surge in serum IgA 

__Sx__ (tetrad)
* Palpable generalised purpura without coagulopathy (75% the PC) %itchy, ++in lower limbs @gravity.
* Arthalgia 84%, migratory/ transient/ oligoarticular esp upper limbs %periarticular swelling + tenderness
* Abdominal pain 50%, %w/N/V, usu week after rash but may precede. 
* Renal disease == %haematuria, %symptoms of renal impairment. up to 50%, 
* Other symptoms include: Subcutaneous edema esp perioribtal, scrotal pain

__Ix:__
* No definitive test.
* FBE, no thrombocytopaenia
* Total IgA elevated in 50-70%
* ++inflam markers
* %hypocomplementaemia, esp @post strep disease.
* Coagulation studies normal
* Renal biopsy == identical to typical IgA nepropathy (reserved for those with atypical rash/ no rash)
* Urinalysis == RBC casts, %%HTN/ proteinuria

__Ddx__:
* Esp @cutaneous manifestations absent, consider IgA nepropathy or other causes of Sx

__Cx__:
* Intussception @GIT involvement, %acute panc, bowel perforation
* @adult, signifcant renal involvement more likely.
