====== VHLSyndrome ======
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
* **Def**: rare AD syndrome == ++benign / malignant tumors. 
	* "von Hippel-Lindau" (VHL gene)
	* Associated malignancies:
		* ++
			* Clear cell renal carcinoma
			* ++%Hemangioblastomas
			* Phaeo (%exta-adrenal)
		* -=
			* ++other rare tumors
* **Mx:** 
	* VHL function as tumor suppressor @E3 ubiquitin ligase, and degrades hydroxylated Hypoxia-inducible factors. @!VHL == HIF even @hydroxylation not removed == transciptional changes which would occur @hypoxia == myc / VEGF/ TGFa. @!VHL == also MMP expression == tumorigenesis.
	* @2hit model, initially @germline mutation #somatic 2nd mutation == dysfunctional VHL in cell line
* **Class:**
	* Type 1
		* ++risk of other VHL-associated tumors
	* Type 2
		* ++risk of phaeo, RCC
* **Sx** 
	* @mean age 26 w/ cancer (benign/ malignant)
		* sx of RCC/ phaeo/ haemangioma in CNS
* **Ix**
	* Screening: after diagnosis, MRI screening for tumors, esp RCC. High rate of relapse after RCC elimination. 
	* Genetic screening for family
	* Phaeo:
		* Plasma/ urinary metanephrines 
* **Rx:**
	* RCC: prev bilateral nephrectomy, now renal sparing w/ radiofrequency ablation/ cryotherapy for small tumors. 
	* Phaeo: surgical removal @symptomatic
