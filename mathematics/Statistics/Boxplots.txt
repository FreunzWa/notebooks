====== Boxplots ======

{{./pasted_image.png}}

Box and whisker plot. 
outliers are depicted as individual points outside the whisker plots
The maximum and minimum points are represented by the flat termination of the whiskers. However, the box plot can be defined to include only results within 1.5*QIR (or some other arbitrary value, but this is common), and all values outside this range are considered statistical outliers to the data. 


==== Interpretation ====
The spacings of the different components  of the box and whisker plot indicates the degree to which the data is dispersed/ skewed. 
* IQR
	* otherwise known as the midspread or the middle 50%, or more technically the H-spread is a measure of statistical dispersion
	* Equal to the differ4ence between the 75th and 25th percentiles. (IQR = Q3-Q1), in the above boxplots the IQR is thus 50. Can be used to determine which data points are statistical outliers.
