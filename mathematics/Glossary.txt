====== Glossary ======

* Secant: from latin "secare: to cut", a secant line is a line that intersects a curve in at least 2 distinct points. 
* Standard part function:
	* standard part function is a function from limited finite hyperreal numbers to teh real numbers.
	* standard part of x is sometimes referred to as the "shadow" 
* Hyperreal number: 
	* non-standard Reals (*R)
	* a way of treating infintie and infinitesimal quantities
	* Introduced @edwin hewitt in 1948
* Weierstrass function	
	* Continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere, the functionis a fractal. 
* Demand curve
	* In economics teh graph that shows the relationship between supply and demand, an inverse function. 1/x
* Independent vs dependent variable
	* in the function f(x), the dependent variable is f (depends on the value of x), whilst x is independent (in can take any value in the domain and specifies the range for the function in the process [the set of output values])
	* often written is y=x^2, but since this is a function, should write instead y(x)=x^2, as the value of y depends of the input x. 
* L-estimator
	An estimator which is an L-statistic
