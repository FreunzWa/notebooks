====== Differentiation rules ======

__Product rule:__

For the functions f and g, the derivative of the function h(x) = f(x) g(x) with respect to x is

Leibniz:
{{./pasted_image001.png}}

__Chain rule:__
{{./pasted_image002.png}}, derivative with respect to x is:
{{./pasted_image003.png}}

__Power rule:__
if {{./pasted_image004.png}}for any real number where r is not 0, then derivative of f(x) with respect to x is:
{{./pasted_image005.png}} 
if the base is e, then do no subtract 1 from the exponent
for u^r, where u is a function of x,  f'(x) = r*u^(u-1)*u'

__Logarithmic differentiation with base e__

f(x) = log (x)
f'(x) = 1/x

f(x) = ln(u), where u is some function of x
f'(x) = u' / u , where u' is the derivative of u

__Logarithmic differentiation with bases other than e__

u = f(x)
y = log_b(u)

dy/dx = log(_b(e))*(u'/u)

__Circular function differentiation__
differentiation of sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, cosecant
and each of the inverse trigonometric functions

d/dx (sin x) = cos x * x'
d/dx (cos x) = -sin x * x'
d/dx (tan x) = (sin x/ cos x)' = 1/ (cos^2 x)
	{
	(tanx)′=(sinxcosx)′=(sinx)′cosx−sinx(cosx)′cos2x=cosx⋅cosx−sinx⋅(−sinx)cos2x=cos2x+sin2xcos2x=1cos2x.
	}
	
d/dx (cot x) = (1 / tan(x))'


__Implicit differentiation__
Find derivative of equation not in form of one independent term. 
eg. xy = 1, find y'
rewrite y as y(x), important to recognise as a function of x when do product rule. 
x*y(x) = 1
take derivatives of both sides

d/dx(xy(x)) = d/dx(1)
(1)y(x) + x*d/dx(y(x)) = 0 
y + xy' = 0
