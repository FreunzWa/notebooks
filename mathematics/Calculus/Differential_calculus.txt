====== Differential calculus ======

Derivative of a function measures the sensitivity to change of the function value with resepect to a change in its argument. At a single point the derivative can be represented as the gradient line of a tangent at that point. "instantaneous rate of change"

dy/dx - notation for a ratio between infinitesimal quantities (rate of change of y with respect to x).
* this notation wias introduced by Leibniz in 1675
* Lagrange's (prime) notation, derivative of f is denoted f'
* Newton's notation was the dot notation {{./pasted_image004.png}},{{./pasted_image005.png}}, more common in physics/ differential equations

==== First principles formula ====

defined @calculate gradient between two points on a curve as the limit of differences as it approaches 0 will approach the gradient of the curve at that point. 
gradient m of the tangent, where h is a value very close 0.
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
as h approaches 0, call this the derivative of the function f

for function f(a)=x^2, calculating the derivative using limits at a=3:
{{./pasted_image003.png}}
for a function to be differentiable it must be continuous


==== higher order derivatives ====
2nd derivative is the rate of change of the rate of change, in physics this can represent an object's acceleration.
